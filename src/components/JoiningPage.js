                <p>For PhD opportunities, please apply to the PhD program at Harvard SEAS (e.g., in EE/CS/AM/ME) and list me as a potential advisor. I am also open to taking (undergraduate or graduate) research interns.</p>
                <p><strong>This year I am particularly looking for a strong candidate in statistics and machine learning.</strong></p>
                <p>I am interested in working with self-motivated candidates with (a) a strong theoretical and computational background (e.g., applied math, optimization and control, statistics, machine learning, and scientific computing), and/or (b) rich experiences in real robotic platforms (e.g., drones, manipulators, ground vehicles).</p>
                <p>Due to the large volume of inquiries, I may not be able to reply to all emails, and I apologize for this.</p>
